= Proposal for a type-safe config API

This contains two modules:

* microprofile-config: The public (potentially standardized) API
* kingconf: King Conf, an implementation of that API

Refer to the test in King Conf for the usage.

Kudos to the OWNER framework for the great idea of type-safe config contracts.
